# Project-2 Code Chow
Concept:

Our app allows users find recipes based on the ingredients they have and show the nutrional value of those ingredients.

How to use:

1.  You will initially land on the login/create account page.  If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2.  Upon logging in you'll be taken to your user's homepage, where all your favorite ingredients and recipes will eventually be stored.

3. To search ingredients, simply enter the name of an  ingredient in the field and click the "Ingredient" button.

4. To search recipes, simply enter the name of an ingredient in the field and click the "Recipes" button.

5. To save any of either ingredients or recipes, simply click the "Add to Favorites" button.

6. View you favorites by clicking the home button.
